# Idea for codefundo++

Q) What are you planning to build?

A) I'll be working on an ML model that can classify/predict the occurence of a Natural Disaster based on previous data and also do Twitter Sentiment Analysis in order to manage the disaster.

Q) How does it work?

A) For predicting the disaster, all the various factors that decide the occurence of a particular kind of a Natural Disaster are taken into consideration and a classifier is built to classify whether or not a disaster occurs (or) a large dataset containing images taken by a satellite at the time of occurence of disaster are fed into the model and future disasters are predicted based on the dataset. If the model predicts the occurence of a disaster, then proper measures are to be taken to prevent it.
For managing the disaster, Twitter Sentiment Analysis is done for a group of keywords(relating to a particular crisis), in order to find the geographic locations that were effected by the disaster, and send rescue teams to help the stranded.

Q) How can users get started with the project?

A) If the classifier predicts the occurence of disaster, proper measures are to be taken by the Law Enforcement bodies. And if the disaster has already occured and people are in debris, It connects all the effected users to an established network of first
responders, security teams and law enforcement bodies via voice, text, location and group services, which allows users to quickly find public employees by geographic proximity, area or agency. It also fosters efficient connectivity, collaboration and communication.

Q) What dataset(s) are you using?

A) Seismological, Hydrological, Geological and Remote sensing data from any of the IRIS, NOAA, NASA, ISRO, NGDC or NDMA.

Q) What technologies are you using?

A) Pandas, Matplotlib, Sci-kit Learn, Tensorflow, SAP HANA.
