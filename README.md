# Idea for codefundo++

Q) What are you planning to build?

A) I'll be building a Multilayer Perceptron model that can classify/predict the occurence of a Natural Disaster based on previous data, I'll also be working on building a Convolutional Neural Network which would help in the predicting process to a much higher accuracy just by feeding in the satellite images of a particular place. Twitter Sentiment Analysis shall be done in order to manage the disaster.

Q) How does it work?

A) For predicting the disaster, all the various factors that decide the occurence of a particular kind of a Natural Disaster are taken into consideration and a classifier, in this case a Multilayer Perceptron is built to classify whether or not a disaster occurs (or) the second way would be to train a Convolutional Neural Network using a large dataset containing images taken by a satellite at the time of occurence of disaster, and future disasters are predicted based on this dataset. If the model predicts the occurence of a disaster, then proper measures are to be taken to prevent it.
For managing the disaster, Twitter Sentiment Analysis is done for a group of keywords(relating to a particular crisis), in order to find the geographic locations that were effected by the disaster, and send rescue teams to help the stranded.

Q) How can users get started with the project?

A) All the people effected by the disaster are connected to an established network of first responders, security teams and law enforcement bodies via voice, text, location and group services just by the tap of a button in the app. This allows rescue teams to quickly find out all the effected by the severity of damage caused.

Q) What dataset(s) are you using?

A) Seismological, Hydrological, Geological and Remote sensing data from any of the IRIS, NOAA, NASA, ISRO, NGDC or NDMA.

Q) What technologies are you using?

A) Pandas, Matplotlib, Sci-kit Learn, Tensorflow, SAP HANA.
