# Idea for codefundo++

Q) What are you planning to build?

A) I'll be working on an ML model that can classify/predict the occurence of a Natural Disaster based on previous data and also do Twitter Sentiment Analysis in order to manage the disaster.

Q) How does it work?

A) For predicting the disaster, all the various factors that decide the occurence of a particular kind of a Natural Disaster are taken into consideration and a classifier is built to classify whether or not a disaster occurs. If the model predicts the occurence of a disaster, then proper measures are to be taken to prevent it.
For managing the disaster, Twitter Sentiment Analysis is done for a group of keywords(related to disaster occurence) in order to find the exact location of the disaster, and send rescue teams to help the stranded.

Q) How can users get started with the project?

A)

Q) What dataset(s) are you using?

A)

Q) What technologies are you using?

A) Pandas, Matplotlib, Sci-kit Learn and Tensorflow.
